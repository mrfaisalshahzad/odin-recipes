    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup oil or ghee</li>
            <li>550g chicken, bone in and cut into curry pieces</li>
            <li>600g tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 bulb garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp ginger, minced</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tsp paprika/kashmiri red chilli</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp crushed black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp cumin powder</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp coriander powder</li>
            <li>1tsp kalonji (black seed, optional)</li>
            <li>2 green chillis, slit in half lengthwise</li>
            <li>0.5 bunch coriander, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ginger cut into matchstick pieces</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Heat up your oil in a karahi dish, wok, cast iron skillet or any pan suitable for stirfrying, keeping the flame on high for the entire duration</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the chicken in. Fry this, stirring constantly until the chicken begins to take on a golden colour in some places</p></li>
            <li><p>Add in the minced ginger and garlic. Give this a fry alongside the chicken, again stirring constantly and ensuring nothing burns. Continue to fry this until the raw smell of the ginger and garlic begins to fade</p></li>
            <li><p>Add all the chopped tomatoes and spices. Stir in and allow this all to cook on high, stirring to ensure nothing catches at the bottom of the pan</p></li>
            <li><p>Continue to cook this mix for about 20 minutes. The oil will separate, the tomatoes will thicken and begin to coat the chicken, and you will see holes begin to bubble in the gravy. The chicken should be cooked through at this point</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the coriander and green chillis, stir in, turn the heat down to a low flame and allow everything to simmer together for 5 minutes without putting the lid on</p></li>
            <li><p>Serve with the matchstick-cut ginger and additional coriander/green chilli if desired</p></li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Note:</h2>
        <p>If your chicken hasn't cooked through, you can put the lid on and simmer everything on low for a few additional minutes. Avoid adding water unless absolutely necessary.</p>
        <p>If you don't intend to serve this immediate, stop after step 5. Proceed with step 6 when you are almost about to serve.</p>
        <p>1/2-1 tsp garam masala powder can also be added alongside the coriander optionally. I'd recommend making the garam masala fresh at home for optimal flavour and fragrance.</p>
        <p>If for some reason you have to or want to use onions, I would recommend you add 1 large onion very finely chopped into the oil before the chicken and allow this to cook until lightly golden before adding the chicken.</p>
        <p>I use Himalayan pink salt at home. It is milder than sea salt. Please add salt and adjust according to your own preference</p>
